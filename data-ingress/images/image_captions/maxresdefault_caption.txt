The image presents a clean and corporate style, characteristic of professional and informational presentations. A white backdrop dominates, etched with soft, subtle green lines creating a dynamic sense of movement, simulating a turning page or a dynamic electronic display. The central text, "Rethinking Preventive Drug Education for the New Normal: The ASEAN Experience," is assertively anchored in a deep green banner, which aids clarity and focus. An icon of a light bulb, symbolizing ideas and innovation, adds a graphical element that breaks the textual monotony and engages visual interest. This design choice underpins the theme of innovation and adaptation in a pedagogical context. The overall design, supplemented by the ASEAN and other official logos at the bottom, conveys a sense of organized collaboration and authoritative communication. The color scheme—predominantly green—evokes growth, harmony, and safety, aligning with the themes of education and preventative measures.

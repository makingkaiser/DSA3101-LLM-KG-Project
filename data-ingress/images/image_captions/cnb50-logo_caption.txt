The image presents a commemorative design celebrating 50 years of the Central Narcotics Bureau's efforts in Singapore, encapsulated in a balanced and official-looking graphic. The design incorporates a crest on the left, traditional in style with a shield and laurel motif, rendered in monochrome which enhances its authoritative appeal. Adjacent to this, the text "CNB 50" uses bold, sans-serif typography emphasizing the milestone. The accompanying slogan "CONTINUING THE FIGHT FOR A DRUG-FREE SINGAPORE" is positioned elegantly in a serif font, lending a formal and assertive tone. A turquoise ribbon adds a splash of color, symbolizing awareness and hope, which softens and humanizes the overall design. The composition is simple yet powerful, reflecting a serious, dedicated mission through a classic and professional aesthetic.

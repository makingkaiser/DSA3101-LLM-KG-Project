            <h2>The Social Impact of Cannabis Use</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Isolation:</strong> Regular cannabis use can sometimes lead to social withdrawal. Users might find themselves spending more time alone, distancing from friends and family.</li>
                <li><strong>Depression:</strong> There is a potential link between frequent cannabis use and increased feelings of depression. This can be due to various factors including changes in brain chemistry and the impact of isolation.</li>
                <li><strong>Social Stigma:</strong> Cannabis users may face judgment or stigma from their peers or society, which can further contribute to feelings of isolation and depression.</li>
                <li><strong>Impact on Relationships:</strong> Cannabis use can strain personal relationships, as changes in behavior and priorities may lead to conflicts or misunderstandings with loved ones.</li>
                <li><strong>Community Engagement:</strong> Conversely, some users might find a sense of community among fellow cannabis enthusiasts, which can mitigate some of the negative social effects.</li>

**Subject:** Proposal for Cross-Department Collaboration on IBM Watson Discovery

Hi Team,

I hope this email finds you well.

I am writing to propose a cross-department collaboration to enhance our promotional strategies for IBM Watson Discovery. We have a unique opportunity to showcase real-time analytics capabilities and predictive models integration using IBM Planning Analytics, along with robust security protocols on Microsoft Azure.

Yasmine, your expertise in building predictive models could be instrumental in demonstrating how IBM Planning Analytics can add value to IBM Watson Discovery. Michael, ensuring that our solutions are secure on Microsoft Azure will be crucial. Kevin, your experience with developing models for IBM Watson Studio will be beneficial in refining the AI capabilities of Watson Discovery.

Let's schedule a meeting early next week to discuss this proposal in more detail. Please let me know your availability.

Best regards,

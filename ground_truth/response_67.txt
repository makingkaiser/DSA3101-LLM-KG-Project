Hi Yasmine and Samuel,

I hope this email finds you well. As you know, we are working on the upcoming launch of our new hybrid cloud solutions for IBM Cloud Private. I wanted to get some updates and insights from both of you.

Yasmine, could you provide an update on the predictive models you're building for IBM Planning Analytics? Any insights on customer trends would be immensely helpful.

Samuel, how are things progressing with Hyperledger Fabric for the IBM Blockchain Platform? Also, are there any potential synergies you see that we can leverage for our hybrid cloud solutions?

Lily, I’ve cc'd you to keep you in the loop for any marketing analysis or customer trend data that may be relevant.

Looking forward to your updates.

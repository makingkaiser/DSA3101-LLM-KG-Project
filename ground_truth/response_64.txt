Subject: Collaboration on AI and Mobile Security

Hi Emma,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to discuss a potential collaboration between our departments that could leverage the Google Cloud AI Platform for enhanced threat detection within mobile applications. 

Given your expertise as a Product Manager for Google Cloud AI Platform, and considering Xander's work on the IBM MobileFirst Platform, I believe we could explore integrating advanced AI capabilities to improve our security measures.

Could we set up a meeting to brainstorm some ideas? 

Best,
Jackie Lin

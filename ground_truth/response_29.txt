**Email 1: From Jackie Lin to Xander Williams, CC: Yasmine Ali, Derek Hill**

Hi Xander,

I hope this email finds you well.

I wanted to set up a meeting to discuss the integration of the IBM MobileFirst Platform with Veeva Systems. We need to ensure that the mobile applications we develop will align with the security protocols required by Veeva Systems, especially in the context of life sciences data.

Yasmine, as the lead Data Scientist, your expertise in predictive models will be crucial for this integration, especially in terms of data analytics and compliance. Derek, we'll need your QA insights to ensure that our software meets the stringent quality standards of Veeva Systems.

Can we schedule a meeting for this Friday at 10 AM?

Best,
Jackie Lin

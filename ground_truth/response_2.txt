#### Email 1: From David Patel to Benji Martinez

**Subject:** AWS Infrastructure Review Meeting

Hi Benji,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding the AWS infrastructure we're currently architecting. Given the scale and complexity, I believe it would be beneficial to have a review meeting to ensure that our plans align with the IBM Cloud Object Storage requirements.

Could you please let me know your availability for a meeting next week? We can also loop in Rachel Singh for her insights on backend development for IBM Cloud Functions.

Best regards,  
David Patel  
Cloud Architect, IT Department

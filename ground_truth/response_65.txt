Hi Team,

I wanted to give you all a quick update on our ongoing work with IBM Cognos Analytics. We have successfully integrated the new analytics module and it’s showing promising results so far.

**Abigail**, I’m attaching a draft of the new reporting dashboards for your review. Your feedback will be invaluable for refining these features.

**Gina**, your UX designs have been incorporated, and early user testing shows significant improvement in user satisfaction. Great job!

**Derek**, I’ll need you to conduct a QA pass on the analytics module next week. Let me know your availability.

Thanks,

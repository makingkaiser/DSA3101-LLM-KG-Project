**Subject: Data Integration for Enhanced Analytics**

**Hi Ivy,**

I hope this email finds you well.

I wanted to discuss the integration of our ETL pipelines with the IBM Db2 Database to enhance the analytics insights for IBM Cognos Analytics. Your expertise in building these pipelines will be crucial for this task.

Additionally, Michael, I’d appreciate your input on ensuring the security protocols are robust enough, especially since some of the data will be processed through Microsoft Azure.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,

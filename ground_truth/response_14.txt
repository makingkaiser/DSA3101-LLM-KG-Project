Hi Kevin and Emma,

I hope you both are doing well. I am reaching out to discuss an exciting opportunity to leverage our expertise in predictive modeling for a project on the Google Cloud AI Platform.

Kevin, given your experience with IBM Watson Studio, I believe your insights would be invaluable in developing new models for this platform. Emma, as the Product Manager, your strategic input will be crucial for aligning this project with our overall product roadmap.

Let's schedule a meeting next week to brainstorm and outline our next steps. How does Wednesday at 10 AM EST work for you both?

Best,

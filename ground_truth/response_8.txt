*Subject:* Collaboration on AI Integration for IBM Maximo and IBM Watson

Hi Oliver and Derek,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to discuss our upcoming project on integrating IBM Watson's natural language processing capabilities with IBM Maximo Asset Management. This integration aims to enhance our AI solutions by adding sophisticated language understanding and processing features.

Oliver, your expertise in natural language processing will be invaluable for this project. We need to outline the initial requirements and technical specifications. Derek, once we have a prototype, your team will be essential in performing rigorous QA testing to ensure everything runs smoothly.

Victor, I’ve CC’d you as we might need some RPA bots to automate certain repetitive tasks within the Maximo system. Your insights will be critical in identifying these areas.

Lily, your analysis on customer trends for IBM Cloud Satellite could provide us with strategic insights on how to market this new integration effectively.

Looking forward to your thoughts and feedback.

Best,
Wendy Chen

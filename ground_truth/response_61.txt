#### Email 1: Request for Meeting

**From:** Franklin Moore  
**To:** Michael Turner, Zachary Brooks, Derek Hill  
**CC:** Cognex, Client Team  
**Subject:** Scheduling a Meeting for API Integration and Security Review

Hi Team,

I hope this email finds you well. We need to schedule a meeting to discuss the integration of the new APIs for IBM Watson Assistant with Microsoft Azure, and to review the security protocols. Cognex has expressed interest in this integration and wants to ensure that our security measures meet their standards.

Michael, can you provide us with a preliminary overview of the security protocols you've designed for Microsoft Azure?

Zachary, we'll also need your input on how we can implement these protocols using IBM Cloud Pak for Integration.

Derek, could you please prepare to discuss the QA tests for IBM Aspera that may overlap with this integration?

Can everyone share their availability for a meeting next week? 

Thank you,
Franklin

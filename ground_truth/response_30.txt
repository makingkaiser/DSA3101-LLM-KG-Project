**Subject: Follow-up on AWS and IBM Cloud Integration**

Hi David,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to follow up on our recent discussion about integrating AWS infrastructure with IBM Cloud Private. This integration is critical for our hybrid cloud solution strategy, and we need to outline the next steps.

Samuel, could you provide an update on how Hyperledger Fabric can facilitate secure transaction processes in this integration? Your blockchain expertise will be invaluable here.

Lily, it would be great if you could analyze customer trends related to hybrid cloud adoption, particularly focusing on IBM Cloud Satellite. This will help us tailor our strategy to meet market demand.

Thanks,

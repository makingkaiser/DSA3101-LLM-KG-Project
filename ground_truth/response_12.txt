Subject: AI Integration for Veeva Systems Project

Hi Team,

We have an upcoming project with Veeva Systems to integrate AI functionalities into their cloud solutions. This will involve various components, including natural language processing and data management. Here are the key tasks and who I believe should lead them:

- **Ivy Bennett**: Can you handle building the ETL pipelines for the data from Veeva's systems to our IBM Db2 Database?
- **Oliver James**: We'll need your expertise in natural language processing for developing the AI models using IBM Watson Language Translator.
- **Zachary Brooks**: Your role will be critical in implementing the solutions within IBM Cloud Pak for Integration.

Let's discuss this further in our meeting tomorrow.

Best,
Wendy Chen

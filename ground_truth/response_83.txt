**Subject:** Collaboration on Hybrid Cloud Solution for Zscaler Integration

Hi Uma,

I hope this email finds you well.

We have an exciting opportunity to integrate Zscaler's cloud-based security solutions with IBM Cloud Pak for Data. As the lead UX Designer, I'm keen to ensure that the user interface is intuitive and seamlessly integrates with our existing system.

Could you provide some insights on the architecture of the hybrid cloud solution? This will help us design a more efficient user interface.

Also, Lily, could you share any customer trend data related to security solutions that might help us tailor this integration?

Xander, I may need your expertise in developing some mobile app features related to this integration later.

Looking forward to your inputs.

Best,
Gina Lopez

Hi Gina,

Thanks for initiating this discussion.

For the integration with Zscaler, we will be leveraging IBM Cloud Private to ensure a secure and hybrid environment. The architecture involves multiple layers of security and data privacy that Zscaler complements very well.

Lily, any customer insights you can provide will be valuable for understanding the market demand and customer expectations.

Xander, once the initial designs are ready, I'll loop you in to discuss the mobile application aspects.

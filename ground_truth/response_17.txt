**Subject:** Integration of Security Protocols with IBM Watson Assistant APIs

Hi Franklin and Brian,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to discuss the integration of the security protocols I've been designing for Microsoft Azure with the APIs you’re developing for IBM Watson Assistant. 

Brian, given your extensive work with Microsoft Azure in the R&D Department, your insights will be invaluable. Franklin, your expertise in developing APIs for Watson Assistant will be crucial in ensuring a seamless integration.

I’ve cc'd Natalie and Abigail to keep them in the loop. Natalie, this integration will be a significant selling point for our enterprise clients, and Abigail, your reporting and dashboard expertise for IBM Cognos Analytics will help us track the progress.

Could we set up a meeting next week to discuss this in detail?

Best regards,

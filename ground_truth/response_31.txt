Hi Team,

I hope this email finds you well.

As part of our ongoing collaboration between the Ethics Department and Operations Department, we need to schedule a meeting to discuss integrating ethical considerations into our CI/CD pipelines for the IBM Kubernetes Service. Henry, I know you have been working on automating these pipelines, and your insights will be invaluable.

Benji, your experience in overseeing infrastructure for IBM Cloud Object Storage will be crucial in understanding the broader implications of this integration. Derek, your expertise in QA will help ensure that our ethical guidelines are effectively tested.

Please suggest a few time slots that work for you this week.

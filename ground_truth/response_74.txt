Hi Alice,

Thank you for the update and kind words. I'm glad the APIs for IBM Watson Assistant are proving useful. 

Quinn, Benji, and I had a brief discussion yesterday about potential enhancements for our next sprint. We’re considering integrating some features from the Databricks platform to improve our AI data processing. 

Would love to hear your thoughts on this.

Hi Alice, Franklin, and Benji,

Great to hear from you all. Alice, thanks for the update and for highlighting our contributions. 

Franklin, I think integrating Databricks for our AI data processing could be a game changer. I can start looking into how we can adapt our current analytics framework in IBM Cognos Analytics to better utilize Databricks.

Benji, any potential infrastructure challenges we should be aware of with this integration?

Best,

Hi Team,

Alice, thank you for the updates and recognition. 

Franklin, Quinn, regarding the Databricks integration, from an infrastructure standpoint, I foresee minimal challenges. Our current setup for IBM Cloud Object Storage should be able to handle the additional load. However, I'll conduct a thorough review and stress test to ensure smooth implementation.

Looking forward to our continued collaboration.

Best,

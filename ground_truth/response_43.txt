**Subject:** Initial UX Design Feedback for MobileFirst App

Hi Gina,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to share some initial feedback on the UX design you've created for the new MobileFirst app. Overall, it looks fantastic, but I have a few suggestions to enhance user interaction.

Can we schedule a quick call to discuss this? I'll loop in Alice and Quinn as they might have valuable insights from the data analytics perspective.

Hi Gina,

I hope this email finds you well.

As we continue to develop advanced models for IBM Watson Studio, we have identified the need for an improved user interface that aligns with user needs. Your expertise in designing interfaces for IBM Cloud Pak for Data would be invaluable for this project.

Could we arrange a meeting next week to discuss potential collaboration on this? I have cc'd Kevin and Xander as their inputs on machine learning models and mobile app integration will be crucial.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

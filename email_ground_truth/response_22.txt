**Subject: Team Coordination for Upcoming RPA Project**

Hi Team,

I hope this email finds you well. As part of our new RPA initiative using IBM Robotic Process Automation, we need to ensure that all aspects of our project are well-coordinated.

Derek, could you start by outlining the QA testing plan for the bots? Your expertise with IBM Aspera should help us benchmark against our quality standards.

David, we'll need your input on how best to integrate the bots with our AWS infrastructure. Can you draft an initial architecture design?

Lily, it would be beneficial if you could provide insights on customer trends from your analysis of IBM Cloud Satellite. This data will help us tailor our bots more effectively.

Abigail, once we have initial data and results, could you set up a reporting dashboard using IBM Cognos Analytics? This will help us monitor progress and identify any issues early.

Thanks, everyone. Let’s aim to have a preliminary meeting next Tuesday.

Best regards,
Victor Ramos  
RPA Developer, Automation Department  
IBM

Hi Victor,

I’ve started drafting the QA testing plan for the bots. Given our previous experience with IBM Aspera, I think we can leverage some of the existing testing frameworks.

David and I can coordinate closely to ensure that the testing environments align with the AWS architecture.

Lily, your insights will definitely be useful for setting up use cases for the QA tests.

Abigail, I’ll share the test results with you as soon as we have them so that you can integrate them into the dashboards.

Looking forward to our meeting next Tuesday.

Best,
Derek Hill  
QA Engineer, Quality Assurance Department

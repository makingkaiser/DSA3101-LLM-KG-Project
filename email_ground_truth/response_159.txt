**Subject:** Project Update: Google Cloud AI Platform & IBM Aspera Integration  

Hi Team,

I hope this email finds you well. As part of our ongoing efforts to integrate the Google Cloud AI Platform with IBM Aspera, I wanted to provide a quick update on our progress and next steps.

**Henry:** How's the CI/CD pipeline automation coming along for the IBM Kubernetes Service? We need to ensure that everything is streamlined for our deployment phase.

**Derek:** Could you please share the latest test results for the IBM Aspera software? We need to ensure that the current build is stable before we proceed with further integrations.

**Kevin:** Any updates on the new models for IBM Watson Studio? These need to align with the Google Cloud AI Platform capabilities.

Let's aim to have a brief sync-up meeting on Friday at 2 PM to discuss our progress and any blockers.

Best regards,

Subject: Feedback Request: Enhancing IBM Security Guardium Integration with IBM Z Systems

Hi Paul and Tina,

I hope you're both doing well.

As part of the ongoing efforts to improve our IBM Security Guardium integration with IBM Z systems, I would like to gather some feedback on the recent updates we've made. Specifically, we're looking at how threat detection capabilities are performing on the Z systems infrastructure.

Paul, could you provide any insights or observations on the performance and any potential areas for improvement?

Tina, we would also appreciate any feedback from the clients who are using IBM QRadar SIEM and IBM Security Guardium in tandem. Have they reported any issues or suggested enhancements?

Michael, feel free to chime in if you have any recommendations from a cloud security perspective, especially concerning integration with Microsoft Azure.

Looking forward to your input.

Best,

Hi Jackie,

Thanks for reaching out. From a systems engineering perspective, the integration has been relatively smooth. However, there are a few areas where we could improve performance, particularly around data transfer speeds between IBM Z and Guardium.

I'll compile a detailed report and share it with you later this week.

Tina, I'd be interested to hear what the clients have been saying too.

Best,

Hi Jackie and Paul,

Thanks for looping me in. From the client feedback we've received, most of them are satisfied with the IBM QRadar SIEM and IBM Security Guardium integration. However, a few have mentioned that they would like to see better real-time alerting features.

I think enhancing the alerting system could add significant value. I will gather more specific feedback from clients and share it by the end of the week.

Michael, do you think any cloud security features on Microsoft Azure could help enhance these integrations?

Best,

Hi everyone,

From a cloud security perspective, there are definitely some features on Microsoft Azure that we can leverage to enhance the integration. For example, Azure Sentinel could be a valuable addition to our threat detection capabilities, providing advanced analytics and threat intelligence.

I can set up a meeting to discuss this in more detail if you think it would be beneficial.

Subject: Updates on IBM Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and Blockchain Integration

Hi Carol, Samuel, and Natalie,

I hope this email finds you all well.

I wanted to provide an update on our current progress with IBM RPA and our potential integration with the IBM Blockchain Platform. We’ve been developing some new bots that can automate various business processes, and it looks promising.

Samuel, I think this is where your expertise in Hyperledger Fabric could come in handy. We are considering how we might use blockchain to ensure the security and transparency of these automated processes.

Carol, could you assist us by analyzing the data we’ve gathered so far? Your work with Microsoft Azure might give us some valuable insights.

Natalie, once we have more concrete results, I will need your support to promote these new capabilities to our enterprise clients, especially focusing on how IBM Watson Discovery can complement these tools.

Looking forward to your thoughts and collaboration.

Best regards,
Victor Ramos
RPA Developer, IBM

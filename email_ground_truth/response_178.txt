**Subject:** Collaboration on New Feature for IBM Watson Studio

Hi Team,

I hope you're all doing well.

As part of our continuous improvement plan for IBM Watson Studio, we need to incorporate a new predictive analytics feature. Yasmine, your expertise as a Data Scientist in building predictive models for IBM Planning Analytics would be crucial. Xander, we will also need your input on integrating this feature into our mobile applications developed for IBM MobileFirst Platform. Derek, I rely on your skills as a QA Engineer to ensure the quality and robustness of this new feature.

Could we set up a meeting to discuss the technical requirements and development timelines? Please let me know your availability.

Best regards,
Kevin O'Reilly

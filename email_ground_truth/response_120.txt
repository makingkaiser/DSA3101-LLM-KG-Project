Hi Quinn, Abigail,

I reviewed the data on Microsoft Azure, and I can confirm the trends you've identified. There are some interesting patterns in user behavior that align with the recent updates. I suggest we set up a meeting to discuss these findings and next steps.

Paul, could you ensure our IBM Z systems infrastructure is optimized for these analytics tasks? We might need to handle increased data loads.

Hi Gina,

I hope you're doing well. I'm reaching out regarding the backend development work we're doing for IBM Cloud Functions. We're planning some integration with the IBM Cloud Pak for Data, and I think your expertise in UX design could significantly enhance the user experience for this project.

Could we set up a meeting next week to discuss this further? I believe Oliver and Xander might also have valuable input on the natural language processing and mobile application aspects, respectively.

Thanks,
Rachel

Hi Rachel,

Thanks for reaching out. I'd be happy to collaborate on this. The integration of UX design into the backend development for IBM Cloud Functions sounds like a great idea. Let's schedule a meeting for next Tuesday at 3 PM. Does that work for everyone?

Looking forward to it,
Gina

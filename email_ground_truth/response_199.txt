Hi Michael and Franklin,

I hope you're both doing well.

As you know, we are preparing to promote IBM Watson Discovery to some of our enterprise clients. Before we proceed, I wanted to gather your feedback on the integration aspects, especially from a security and API development perspective.

Michael, could you please review the security protocols we have in place for integration with Microsoft Azure? I want to ensure that everything is airtight before we go live.

Franklin, I would appreciate it if you could look over the APIs for IBM Watson Assistant and check if there are any potential improvements or issues that might arise during integration with Watson Discovery.

Paul, if you have any insights from the systems engineering side, particularly concerning IBM Z systems, your input would be invaluable.

Thanks, everyone. Looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards,

Hi Natalie,

Thanks for reaching out. I have reviewed the security protocols for integrating IBM Watson Discovery with Microsoft Azure. Overall, the setup looks robust, but I recommend adding an additional layer of encryption for data in transit. This will ensure that our clients' data remains secure at all times.

Franklin, could you verify if this additional encryption layer would have any impact on the APIs?

Hi Michael and Natalie,

I've looked into the encryption suggestion, and it seems feasible without causing any significant impact on the APIs for IBM Watson Assistant. In fact, it might even enhance the overall security framework of our integration.

Paul, do you foresee any issues from the systems engineering side with implementing this additional encryption layer?

Hi everyone,

Thanks for bringing this to my attention. From a systems engineering perspective, implementing an additional encryption layer should not pose any significant challenges. Our IBM Z systems infrastructure is well-equipped to handle these adjustments. Iâ€™ll ensure that our team is prepared for this integration.

Let me know if there's anything else you need from the IT Support Department.

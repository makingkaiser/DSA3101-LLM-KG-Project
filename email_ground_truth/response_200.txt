Hi Benji,

I hope this email finds you well.

I wanted to provide an update on the integration of Microsoft Azure into our cloud services. We are on track for the upcoming product launch next month. Your team’s support in ensuring the infrastructure is ready for the scale of deployment will be critical.

Tina, could you please coordinate with Benji's team to ensure the IBM QRadar SIEM integration is seamless for our clients?

Clara, as we move forward, your insights on AI ethics will be invaluable, particularly for the AI components in Microsoft Azure.

Looking forward to your feedback and support.

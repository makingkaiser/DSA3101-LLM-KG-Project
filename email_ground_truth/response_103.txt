**Subject:** Proposal for Integrating IBM Watson Assistant with IBM Cloud Functions

Hi Rachel,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to discuss a potential integration between IBM Watson Assistant and IBM Cloud Functions. Given your expertise in backend development for Cloud Functions, I believe you could provide valuable insights on this.

Our goal is to create a more seamless interaction experience for users utilizing IBM Watson Assistant. Alice, from the R&D department, could provide strategic guidance, and Kevin from AI Research could offer support on developing necessary models.

Could we arrange a meeting next week to discuss this further? Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,
Franklin Moore

Subject: Update on IBM Watson Discovery & IBM Cloud Satellite Integration Project

Hi Team,

I hope everyone is doing well. I wanted to provide an update on the IBM Watson Discovery and IBM Cloud Satellite integration project. 

Lily, could you please share the latest customer trend analysis? We need to understand how our clients are reacting to the integration and any emerging patterns that can help us refine our approach.

Kevin, any progress on the models for IBM Watson Studio? These models will be crucial for enhancing the AI capabilities of our new platform.

Quinn, could you prepare a preliminary analytics report for our next meeting? It should include insights from IBM Cognos Analytics that could assist in our current strategy.

Let's aim to meet next Tuesday to discuss our findings and next steps. 

Best,
Natalie Wu

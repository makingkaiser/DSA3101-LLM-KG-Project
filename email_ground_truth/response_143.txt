Hi Uma,

I hope you're doing well. I'm reaching out to discuss a potential collaboration between our departments. As you know, our team has been promoting IBM Watson Discovery to enterprise clients, but we've noticed an increasing interest in hybrid cloud solutions. 

Given your expertise in architecting hybrid cloud solutions for IBM Cloud Private, I believe there's a significant opportunity for us to align our efforts. Additionally, I think we could involve Samuel to explore integrating Hyperledger Fabric into our marketing strategy to appeal to our blockchain-focused clients.

Could we set up a meeting next week to discuss this further? I believe Clara's input on AI ethics, especially regarding data usage in cloud environments, would be invaluable as well.

Best regards,  
Natalie Wu

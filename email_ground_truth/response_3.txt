**Hi Alice and Victor,**

I hope this email finds you well.

I wanted to touch base about a potential collaboration between our teams. As you know, IBM Watson Discovery is doing great in the market, but we are always looking for ways to enhance its capabilities. I believe integrating some RPA functionalities could add significant value to our enterprise clients.

Victor, could you explore how IBM Robotic Process Automation can be integrated with Watson Discovery? It would be great to get your expert opinion on this. Alice, I would appreciate your insights on the data aspects we need to consider for this integration.

Let's aim for a preliminary discussion next week. Lily, could you help us with some customer trend analysis for Watson Discovery? Benji, your input on the infrastructure requirements for this potential integration would also be valuable.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

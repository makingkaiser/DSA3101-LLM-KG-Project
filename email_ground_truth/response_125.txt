**Subject:** Updates on Machine Learning Model Integration with IBM Cloud Functions

Hi Rachel,

I hope you are doing well.

I wanted to give you an update on our progress with the new machine learning models we are developing for IBM Watson Studio. We have successfully completed the initial phase of model training, and the results are promising.

However, we need to discuss the integration of these models into IBM Cloud Functions. Can we set up a meeting later this week to go over the API specifications and deployment procedures?

Best regards,
Kevin O'Reilly

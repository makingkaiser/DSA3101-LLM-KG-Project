Hi Emma and Benji,

Hope you're both doing well.

I've been working on a preliminary market analysis for our cloud security protocols on Microsoft Azure. Emma, I believe your insights on the Google Cloud AI Platform could be invaluable here. Benji, any updates on the infrastructure for IBM Cloud Object Storage would also be greatly appreciated.

Yasmine, could you assist us with some predictive modeling for this market analysis using IBM Planning Analytics?

Looking forward to your thoughts.

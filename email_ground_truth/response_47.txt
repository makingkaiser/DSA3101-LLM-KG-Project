**Subject:** ETL Data Integration for Cognos Analytics

Hi Ivy,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to discuss the possibility of creating new ETL pipelines for our IBM Cognos Analytics reporting. Specifically, I need to integrate data from multiple sources, including IBM Db2 Database.

Could we set up a time to discuss this further?

Best,

Hi Tina,

I wanted to share some feedback from one of our clients using IBM QRadar SIEM. They mentioned difficulties in integrating the solution with their existing security infrastructure.

Could you look into this and provide some support? We might need to collaborate closely to resolve these issues.

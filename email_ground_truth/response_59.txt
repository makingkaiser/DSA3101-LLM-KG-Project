Hi Team,

I hope this email finds you well.

I'm excited to announce that we've received the green light to start working on integrating AI capabilities into our CI/CD pipeline for the IBM Kubernetes Service. Wendy, we will need your expertise in AI solutions to ensure seamless integration with IBM Maximo Asset Management.

Abigail, I'll need you to set up dashboards in IBM Cognos Analytics to monitor our progress and provide insights. Victor, your role will be crucial for automating some of the repetitive tasks using IBM Robotic Process Automation.

Can we schedule a kick-off meeting for next Monday to discuss our strategy and responsibilities?

Hi Yasmine and Natalie,

I hope this email finds you well. As we look to enhance our service offerings, I want to discuss a potential integration between IBM Cloud Pak for Data and IBM Planning Analytics.

Yasmine, I understand that your team is currently developing predictive models for IBM Planning Analytics. Integrating these capabilities into IBM Cloud Pak for Data could provide a seamless experience for our enterprise clients.

Natalie, could you share insights on how this integration can be marketed to our clients, especially those already using IBM Watson Discovery? I believe emphasizing the combined analytical and data management capabilities could be a strong selling point.

Gina, I’m looping you in as we might need a revamped user interface to facilitate this integration.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

Hi Benji,

Thank you for bringing this up. Integrating IBM Planning Analytics with IBM Cloud Pak for Data indeed sounds promising. My team and I have been working on some advanced predictive models that can certainly be leveraged within this new framework.

Natalie, I believe showcasing a few case studies where predictive analytics directly improved decision-making could be quite impactful. We can also offer a webinar to demonstrate these features to potential clients.

Gina, I’d love to hear your ideas on how we can make the user interface more intuitive for this integration.

Hi All,

I’m excited about this integration project. From the UX perspective, we can design a more cohesive and user-friendly interface that seamlessly blends IBM Planning Analytics features into IBM Cloud Pak for Data. This should improve the overall user experience and help clients efficiently navigate between different functionalities.

I will start drafting some initial designs and wireframes and share them with you for feedback.

Xander and Samuel, I'll ensure the data is formatted in a way that could be useful for your respective projects on IBM MobileFirst Platform and IBM Blockchain Platform.

Hi Michael, Quinn, and Samuel,

Thanks for the update, Quinn. The data on hybrid cloud solutions will definitely be useful for the ongoing development on IBM MobileFirst Platform. I'll coordinate with you once the data is available to integrate insights into our mobile applications strategy.

Samuel, we should discuss how these trends might affect our work on the IBM Blockchain Platform, particularly Hyperledger Fabric's integration with cloud services.

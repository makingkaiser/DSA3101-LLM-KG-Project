#### Email 1: From Paul Hernandez to Abigail Carter

**Subject:** Collaboration on IBM Cognos Analytics Dashboard Update

**Hi Abigail,**

I hope this email finds you well.

I wanted to discuss the upcoming dashboard update for IBM Cognos Analytics. We have received several requests from our clients for more detailed insights into their IBM Z systems infrastructure. It would be beneficial to integrate some of this data into the Cognos dashboards.

Would you be available for a brief meeting later this week to go over the requirements and see how we can implement these changes efficiently?

Best regards,
**Paul Hernandez**

**Hi Paul,**

Thank you for reaching out. Integrating IBM Z systems data into the Cognos dashboards sounds like a fantastic idea. I can certainly make time for a meeting this Friday at 2 PM.

I'll also loop in Ivy Bennett since we might need her expertise on ETL pipelines and data integration from the IBM Db2 Database.

Looking forward to our discussion.

Best,

I agree that integrating data from IBM Z systems into the Cognos dashboards can provide more value to our clients. Iâ€™ll review the current ETL pipelines and see what adjustments might be needed to support this integration.

**Subject:** Re: Collaboration on IBM Cognos Analytics Dashboard Update

**Hi Team,**

Just a quick note to let you know that I might have some valuable input regarding the client-side implementation, especially since many of our customers use IBM QRadar SIEM in conjunction with IBM Z systems.

I'd love to join the meeting on Friday if that's alright.

Thanks,

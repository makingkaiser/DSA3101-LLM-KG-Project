Hi Paul and Tina,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to provide an update on the integration testing for IBM Aspera. We've encountered a few issues related to the IBM Z systems infrastructure that need immediate attention. 

Could you please look into the infrastructure logs to identify any potential bottlenecks?

Additionally, Tina, I would need your assistance with IBM QRadar SIEM to ensure our security measures are robust during these tests.

Best,
Derek

Hi Paul, Derek,

I've verified the security configurations for IBM QRadar SIEM, and everything is up to standard. We should be good to proceed with the integration testing once Paul's patch is applied.

Quinn, could you run a quick analytics report on IBM Cognos Analytics to ensure the data integrity post-patch?

Thanks,
Tina

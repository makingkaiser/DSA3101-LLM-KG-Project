Hi Team,

I hope this email finds you well. As part of our new innovation initiative, we have an exciting opportunity to collaborate on integrating IBM Cloud Functions with our other IBM products like Cognos Analytics and Maximo Asset Management.

Abigail, I believe your expertise in reporting and dashboards would be invaluable to assess the performance of the integration. Wendy, your experience with designing AI solutions for Maximo Asset Management would be crucial in creating intelligent insights from the integrated data. Jackie, we need your support in ensuring the security of the data flows between these systems using IBM Security Guardium.

Additionally, James Thompson from Snowflake has expressed interest in exploring how their data warehousing capabilities can support our initiative.

Please let me know your thoughts, and if you are available for a kick-off meeting next Monday at 10 AM.

Best,
Rachel Singh

Subject: Integration of IBM Watson Assistant with Hybrid Cloud Solutions

Hi Uma,

I hope you're doing well. As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance our client offerings, I wanted to discuss the potential integration of IBM Watson Assistant APIs with our hybrid cloud solutions in IBM Cloud Private.

The integration could significantly improve our client's ability to deploy AI-driven customer service applications across private and public cloud environments. Could we set up a meeting to discuss this further? I'm also CC'ing Benji to ensure we have the IT infrastructure perspective covered.

Best regards,
Franklin Moore

#### Email 4: From Oliver James to Franklin Moore

Subject: Client Requirements for Natural Language Processing

Hi Franklin,

I hope you're well. I recently had a meeting with one of our clients, Databricks, and they have specific requirements for natural language processing capabilities within their data engineering workflows. Given your experience with IBM Watson Assistant, could we collaborate on designing an API that meets their needs?

Let's discuss this during our meeting next week.

Best,
Oliver James

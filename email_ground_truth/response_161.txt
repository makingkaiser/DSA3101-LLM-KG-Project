Subject: Collaboration Proposal on Enhancing Security for IBM Watson Assistant

Hi Franklin and Henry,

I hope you are both doing well.

As you know, security is a top priority for us, especially with our ongoing projects involving IBM Watson Assistant. I have some initial ideas on how we can enhance our security protocols for this service, particularly when it's integrated with Microsoft Azure.

Franklin, I would like your input on how these security measures can be adapted to the APIs you are developing. Henry, your expertise in automating our CI/CD pipelines could be invaluable in implementing these security protocols seamlessly.

Could we schedule a meeting early next week to discuss this in detail?

Best,
Michael Turner

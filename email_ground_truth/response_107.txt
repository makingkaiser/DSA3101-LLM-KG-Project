**Subject:** Strategic Partnership Proposal with Databricks

Hi Wendy, Rachel, and Franklin,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to discuss a potential strategic partnership with Databricks. Given their strong data engineering and AI platform, I believe this could significantly enhance our IBM Cloud Functions and IBM Maximo Asset Management offerings.

Wendy, your expertise in AI solutions for Maximo could be pivotal here. Rachel, your backend development skills for Cloud Functions are invaluable. Franklin, your work on Watson Assistant APIs will also play a critical role.

Let's schedule a meeting to brainstorm ideas and formulate a proposal. How about Thursday at 10 AM?

Best,
Lily

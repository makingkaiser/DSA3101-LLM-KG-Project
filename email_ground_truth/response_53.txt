Subject: Collaboration Proposal: AI Integration for Google Cloud AI Platform

Hi Emma,

I hope this email finds you well.

I wanted to discuss the potential for integrating some of our AI solutions with the Google Cloud AI Platform. Given your expertise as a Product Manager in the IT Department, I believe your insights could be invaluable for this initiative. Specifically, we're looking at incorporating some of the predictive maintenance features from IBM Maximo Asset Management.

Would you be available for a quick call this week to discuss this further?

Best regards,
Wendy Chen

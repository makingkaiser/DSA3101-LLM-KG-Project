Hi Team,

I hope this email finds you well.

We have an exciting opportunity to collaborate with Cloudera on integrating AI solutions into their enterprise data platform for a major client. As part of this initiative, we will be focusing on enhancing the capabilities of IBM Maximo Asset Management.

Yasmine, could you assist in building predictive models for this project using IBM Planning Analytics? Your expertise in the Research & Analytics Department would be invaluable.

Brian, your experience with Microsoft Azure will be crucial as we look to leverage cloud computing capabilities for data processing and model training.

Emma, I would appreciate your input on the product strategy for this integration, particularly how we can utilize the Google Cloud AI Platform to streamline the development process.

Looking forward to your thoughts and collaboration.

Best regards,

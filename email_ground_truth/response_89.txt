**Subject:** Collaboration on Hyperledger Fabric for AWS Integration

Hi David,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to touch base regarding a potential integration of Hyperledger Fabric with AWS services. Given your expertise as a Cloud Architect, your insights would be invaluable to ensure smooth interoperability between IBM Blockchain Platform and AWS.

Can we schedule a meeting next week to discuss this in detail? I'd also like to involve Benji Martinez from IT Operations to address any infrastructure-related queries.

Best,

Subject: Collaboration on AWS Infrastructure for New Project

Hi David,

I hope this email finds you well. As we discussed last week, our team in the Cloud Solutions Department is kicking off a new project that will leverage IBM Cloud Functions to build a serverless backend. We need your expertise in architecting the AWS infrastructure to ensure seamless integration and scalability.

Kevin and Yasmine will also be involved as we’ll need to incorporate machine learning models from IBM Watson Studio and predictive analytics from IBM Planning Analytics.

Could we schedule a meeting later this week to go over the requirements and draft an initial plan?

Best regards,  
Rachel Singh

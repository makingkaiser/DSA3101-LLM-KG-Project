**Date:** October 10, 2023

Hi Yasmine and Victor,

I hope this email finds you well.

As part of our strategic partnership with Cloudera, we need to integrate our predictive models with our RPA bots to streamline our client's data processing workflows. Yasmine, could you provide an overview of the models you’ve built for IBM Planning Analytics that we can leverage?

Victor, once we have Yasmine's input, let's discuss how we can automate these processes using IBM Robotic Process Automation. 

Tina, I will need your support to ensure our IBM Kubernetes Service can handle the deployment seamlessly. Can we set up a meeting later this week to discuss this in detail?

Thanks,  
Henry Zhou  
DevOps Engineer, Operations Department, IBM

Hi Henry,

Sure, I can provide an overview of the predictive models. The primary ones we use for IBM Planning Analytics include models for sales forecasting, demand prediction, and anomaly detection. These models have shown great accuracy in our recent tests.

Victor, based on this, could you identify the data points that would need to be automated by our RPA bots?

Tina, once Victor outlines the data points, could you ensure we have the necessary support and configurations in IBM QRadar SIEM to monitor and secure the automated processes?

Looking forward to our discussion.

Best,

Hi All,

Thanks for the details, Yasmine.

For the sales forecasting and demand prediction models, we'll need to automate data extraction from our client's sales and inventory databases. The anomaly detection model will require real-time data feeds from various operational systems.

Tina, could you confirm if our IBM QRadar SIEM is ready to monitor these data feeds, and if any additional configurations are needed?

Henry, let's set up a meeting to discuss the deployment on IBM Kubernetes Service. How about Friday at 3 PM?

Best,  
Victor Ramos  
RPA Developer, Automation Department, IBM

Hi Team,

I have reviewed our IBM QRadar SIEM configuration. It is set up to monitor the data feeds mentioned by Victor. We may need to tweak a few settings to optimize performance, but overall, we’re prepared.

Henry, Friday at 3 PM works for me. I’ll join the meeting to discuss any support required from the Technical Services Department.

Looking forward to collaborating on this.

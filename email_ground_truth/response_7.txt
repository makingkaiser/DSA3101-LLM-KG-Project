**Subject:** Customer Trends Analysis for IBM Cloud Satellite

Hi Uma and Kevin,

I wanted to provide an update on the customer trends analysis for IBM Cloud Satellite. Our latest data indicates a growing interest in hybrid cloud solutions, particularly among enterprises already using IBM Db2 Database and IBM Z systems. 

Kevin, it would be great if we could integrate some predictive models from IBM Watson Studio to better understand future trends. Uma, your input on how we can architect these insights into our hybrid cloud solutions would be invaluable.

Paul and Ivy, if either of you have any insights or data that might support this analysis, please share.

Best regards,  
Lily Garcia

Hi Lily,

Thanks for the update. I agree that integrating predictive models from IBM Watson Studio would provide us with deeper insights. Kevin, could you provide a timeline for when we could have these models ready?

Paul, could you ensure that our IBM Z systems are optimized to handle any additional computational load?

Hi Uma and Lily,

I can start working on the predictive models next week, and we should have a preliminary version ready in about two weeks. Paul, I'll need to coordinate with you to ensure our models can run efficiently on the IBM Z systems.

Hi all,

I can provide the necessary ETL pipelines to support the data analysis. I'll start preparing the data sets and share them with the team.

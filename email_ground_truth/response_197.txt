Hi Jackie,

I hope this email finds you well.

As part of our continuous effort to enhance AI ethics within our cybersecurity solutions, I would like to propose a collaboration between the Ethics and Security departments. Given your expertise with IBM Security Guardium, I believe your insights would be invaluable in researching and developing AI ethical frameworks specifically tailored for threat detection systems.

I am keen to discuss this further and explore how we can integrate ethical guidelines into our cybersecurity products. I have looped in Paul and Henry to consider potential technical support and automation requirements for the project.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,  
Clara Diaz

Hi Clara,

Thank you for reaching out. Your proposal sounds exciting and aligns with our current objectives for IBM Security Guardium. Ensuring our threat detection systems adhere to ethical standards is crucial.

I suggest we set up a meeting next week to outline the project scope and identify specific areas where AI ethics can be integrated into our cybersecurity framework. Paul and Henry, your inputs on system integration and automation will be essential.

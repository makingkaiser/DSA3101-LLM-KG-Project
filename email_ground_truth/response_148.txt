**Subject:** Proposal for Integrated Dashboard Project

Hi Ivy and Quinn,

I hope you're both doing well.

I wanted to discuss a new project proposal that focuses on creating an integrated dashboard combining data from IBM Cognos Analytics and IBM Db2 Database. This will streamline reporting and provide more insightful analytics for our internal teams as well as our external clients.

Ivy, given your expertise with ETL pipelines, your role will be crucial for extracting and loading data efficiently. Quinn, your skills in providing analytics insights will be essential for developing the dashboard features.

Could we set up a meeting this week to discuss the requirements and timeline?

Best,

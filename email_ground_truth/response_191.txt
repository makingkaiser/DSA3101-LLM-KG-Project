Subject: AWS Integration Strategy Meeting Follow-Up

Hi Alice,

I hope you are doing well. I wanted to follow up on our meeting about the AWS integration strategy. As the Cloud Architect, I've been working on optimizing the infrastructure for Amazon Web Services (AWS) in our IT Department at IBM.

Could you provide an update on how the development of Microsoft Azure and Symantec Endpoint Security is progressing on your end? Understanding the current status will help us align our AWS architecture accordingly.

Also, Franklin and Kevin, could you provide any insights from the AI Department, especially regarding how IBM Watson Assistant and IBM Watson Studio might interact with our AWS setup?

Thanks,
David

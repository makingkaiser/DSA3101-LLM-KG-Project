**Subject:** Initial Integration Update for Alteryx and IBM Watson Discovery

Hello Team,

I wanted to provide an initial update on the integration project between Alteryx and IBM Watson Discovery. I've been working closely with the Alteryx team to ensure our RPA bots can effectively interact with their platform.

Franklin, could you provide an update on the API developments for IBM Watson Assistant that could be leveraged in this integration?

Quinn, any preliminary insights from the data we've gathered through IBM Cognos Analytics would be invaluable at this stage.

Natalie, I'll need your input on the promotional material for this integrated solution once we have the first successful test.

Best regards,
Victor Ramos  
Robotics Process Automation (RPA) Developer, IBM

Hi Victor,

Thanks for the update. I'm finalizing the API endpoints for IBM Watson Assistant that will be required for our integration with Alteryx. Expect completion by the end of this week.

Quinn, once the API is ready, I'll need your assistance in running some initial data through IBM Cognos Analytics to ensure everything is functioning correctly.

Natalie, I'll also touch base with you to discuss how the new API features can be highlighted in our promotional content.

Best,

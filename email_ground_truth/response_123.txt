**Subject: Feedback Request on IBM Cloud Satellite Security and Ethics**

Hi Team,

I hope this email finds you well.

As part of our ongoing efforts to improve IBM Cloud Satellite, I’m reaching out to gather some feedback on customer trends and how we can better address security and ethical considerations. Your insights will be invaluable for our strategy.

Abigail, could you provide an updated dashboard from IBM Cognos Analytics showing the recent customer engagement metrics?

Michael, we’ve been getting some queries regarding the security protocols for Microsoft Azure integrated with IBM Cloud Satellite. Could you review and suggest any necessary enhancements?

Clara, I’d appreciate it if you could review our current AI ethics policy for IBM AI OpenScale and suggest any improvements based on recent trends and research.

Looking forward to your feedback by the end of this week.

Best regards,
Lily Garcia  
Marketing Analyst, Business Strategy Department

Hi David,

I hope you're doing well. We have a client meeting with Alteryx next week to discuss the progress on the integration of Microsoft Azure with AWS for their data analytics services. Could you provide an update on the AWS infrastructure architecture?

Hi Alice,

The AWS infrastructure for the integration is nearly complete. We are currently in the testing phase. I'll prepare a detailed report and share it by tomorrow. Uma, can you coordinate with the IBM Cloud Private team to ensure our hybrid cloud solutions align with the client's requirements?

Hi David,

Sure, I'll get in touch with the IBM Cloud Private team and ensure everything is in sync. Kevin, could you update us on any new models you are developing in IBM Watson Studio that could be relevant for this project?

Hi Uma,

We have developed a new machine learning model in IBM Watson Studio that can significantly optimize data processing times. I believe it can add value to our project with Alteryx. I'll share the details in our upcoming meeting.

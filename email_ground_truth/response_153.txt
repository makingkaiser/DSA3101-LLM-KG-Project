Hi Yasmine,

I hope this email finds you well.

We need to schedule a meeting to discuss the market analysis for our IBM Planning Analytics project. This will help us align our efforts in developing the predictive models. Henry will also join us to provide insights on how we can automate data deployment using IBM Kubernetes Service.

Could you please provide your availability for next week?

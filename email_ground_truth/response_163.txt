Hi Carol and Natalie,

I hope you're both doing well.

We need to set up a meeting to discuss the security protocols for our data analysis on Microsoft Azure. With Carol assisting in analyzing data and Natalie promoting IBM Watson Discovery, it's crucial we ensure all data and processes are secure.

Ivy, please join us as we might need to discuss the ETL pipelines for IBM Db2 Database and how they integrate with our security protocols.

Can we schedule a meeting next Monday at 10 AM?

Best regards,  
Michael Turner

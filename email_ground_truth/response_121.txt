**To:** Emma Lee, Carol Nguyen, Paul Hernandez  
**CC:** Zscaler-Partners@zscaler.com  
**Subject:** Cross-Functional Meeting for AI and Cloud Integration

Hi Emma, Carol, and Paul,

I hope this email finds you well. We need to schedule a cross-functional meeting to discuss our AI integration with the Google Cloud AI Platform and how it can be leveraged with the IBM Maximo Asset Management and Microsoft Azure. Additionally, we will review our current infrastructure's compatibility, specifically focusing on IBM Z systems.

Emma, it would be great if you could outline the product strategy for Google Cloud AI Platform and any updates from Google’s end. Carol, please prepare some data insights that can help us understand how we are currently utilizing Microsoft Azure. Paul, your input on the current state of our IBM Z systems will be crucial for this discussion.

I would also like to invite representatives from Zscaler to the meeting, as their cloud-based security solutions will be vital for our secure internet access.

Could everyone please provide their availability for a meeting next week?

Best regards,  
Wendy Chen

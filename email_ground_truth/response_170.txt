Hi Team,

I hope this email finds you well. As the IT Operations Manager, I wanted to schedule a meeting to discuss our quarterly review on IBM Cloud Object Storage, particularly focusing on infrastructure improvements and the integration with AWS.

David, as our Cloud Architect, your insights on integrating AWS services would be invaluable. Abigail, your expertise in reporting will help us understand the performance metrics more thoroughly. Franklin, your input on potential API improvements for IBM Watson Assistant would also be highly beneficial.

Looking forward to your availability.

Best Regards,

Hi Benji,

Thank you for setting this up. I am available this Thursday at 10 AM EST. I have some initial thoughts on how we can optimize our AWS integration to better support IBM Cloud Object Storage.

Abigail, I would also like to discuss how your dashboards in IBM Cognos Analytics can incorporate the new data points we'll be collecting.

Franklin, it would be great if you could provide an update on any new API developments for IBM Watson Assistant that could impact our infrastructure.

Best,

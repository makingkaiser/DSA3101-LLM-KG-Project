Subject: Updates on IBM Watson Studio Integration with IBM Cognos Analytics

Hi Team,

I wanted to provide a quick update on the integration of our machine learning models developed for IBM Watson Studio with IBM Cognos Analytics. We have made significant progress and are at the final testing phase.

Abigail, could you please verify the dashboard functionalities and ensure that the reporting is accurate?

Tina, I might need some IT support for the QRadar SIEM implementations that are part of this project. I will get in touch with you for any assistance required.

Jackie, please keep an eye on any potential security vulnerabilities as we move forward with this integration.

Best,

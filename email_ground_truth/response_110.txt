Hi Gina and Jackie,

I hope you're both doing well. We need to schedule a meeting to discuss the integration of security protocols for Microsoft Azure. This will involve collaboration between the Cybersecurity and Product Development departments, focusing on how we can ensure robust security measures while optimizing the user interface for IBM Cloud Pak for Data.

Tina, please join us as well, as we might need your input on potential technical support requirements for IBM QRadar SIEM during the integration process.

Can we aim for next Wednesday at 10 AM?

Best regards,

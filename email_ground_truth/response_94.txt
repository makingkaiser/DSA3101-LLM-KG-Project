#### Email 2: Status Update and Request for Assistance

**From:** Brian Taylor  
**To:** Emma Lee, Carol Nguyen

**Subject:** Re: Follow-up on Microsoft Azure Data Analysis

Hi Emma,

Thank you for the follow-up. We have made significant progress in our data analysis for Microsoft Azure. We have successfully integrated most of the data sources and are currently running the initial analysis models. However, we are encountering some issues with data normalization that could potentially delay our timeline.

Carol, can you please focus on identifying the inconsistencies in the dataset and work on normalizing the data? Your attention to detail will be critical here.

Lily, once we have a stable dataset, I'll forward it to you for the market analysis. I think it's a great idea to meet next Tuesday to align our strategies.

Best,
Brian Taylor

Hi Emma,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to touch base with you regarding the integration of our IBM Z systems infrastructure with the Google Cloud AI Platform. As you know, maintaining seamless interoperability is crucial, and I think our teams could work together to ensure everything runs smoothly.

Clara, it would be great if you could provide some insights on any AI ethics considerations we should keep in mind during this integration, especially regarding IBM AI OpenScale.

Franklin, your expertise in developing APIs for IBM Watson Assistant could be invaluable here. If you could assist us in creating a robust API that bridges our systems with the Google Cloud AI Platform, that would be fantastic.

Let’s schedule a meeting next week to discuss further. How does Tuesday at 10 AM sound?

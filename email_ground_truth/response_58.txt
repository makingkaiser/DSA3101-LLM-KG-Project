Hi Clara,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding our ongoing project on AI ethics for IBM AI OpenScale. We've been making strides in ensuring that our Microsoft Azure integration aligns with the highest ethical standards.

I believe Xander's expertise in developing mobile applications for the IBM MobileFirst Platform will be beneficial for implementing ethical guidelines within our mobile interfaces. Xander, could you join us for a meeting next Tuesday to discuss this in more detail?

Best regards,  
Alice Smith

**Subject:** Integration of Symantec Endpoint Security with IBM Cloud Functions  

Hi Michael,

I hope this email finds you well. We are currently working on a project to integrate Symantec Endpoint Security with IBM Cloud Functions. Given your expertise in designing security protocols for Microsoft Azure, I believe your insights could be invaluable in ensuring the security aspects of this integration.

Rachel will be handling the backend development for IBM Cloud Functions, and Samuel will provide support from the blockchain perspective using Hyperledger Fabric.

Could we schedule a meeting later this week to discuss this further? Your availability and input will be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,  
Alice Smith
